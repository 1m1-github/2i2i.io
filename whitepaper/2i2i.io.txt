So, We're talking about. Twite y. Dot.io. The info box. The io.

Uh, what's it called? Like underlined or not underlined but um, bolded basically. But Yeah, i've blanking on the word. Highlighted a highlighted Right. That was it a highlighted to show for the i/o, basically? All right. And in. Info box. Is. Io inbox. Wait inbox, i owe from inbox. That works also inbox. Try toy.io, you're inbox. Not info box inbox. I don't know or should we call it info box? Or just call it inbox? Info box. It's a generalization. It's where, and Info is in the form of text messages. And, This is where info comes to. You information, comes to you. In the form of text messages. And, Ordered by. Ordered by. Importance. Defined by, Society. Each. Info. Ah, maybe this is too complicated for people to get Each message in your text box. And each message in your text box. Comes attached. With some currency. The currency in the form of any coin. Yeah, and And the toy toy theory gives us the ordering of this inbox. And, Fairly distributes. Time and access. Note. That. It is not which It is not simply. More coins, give you more access, which would be an auction market, but the toy toy theory. States. A generalized. Market. Containing the auction, fixed iron barter markets as special cases.

Currently

many. Sources of information. Do not give any access to the world. At all. Think of your favorite celebrity. Lots of people. Do not. Publish. Email. They're direct email. Because, They would otherwise be inundated. With messages. Instead. Everyone. Should open allow access. Which is. Ordered, according to social importance. The more someone needs to reach. Another person. The more important in the form of coins, which can be of objective, or Exor subjective value x4 means exclusive or And, This is just like gmail and algorithm was developed in the 90s. That created. Gmail. That sorted. According to one's own chosen. Search term. Twice. Revolutionizes. Improves provides. An inbox based on social importance. Any. Entity. Can send a message to any other entity. The recipient. Of the message. Receives the coins. If it replies. The sender. Of the message can anytime. Cancel. The mess in which case the message disappears. From the inbox. Of the other. And the sender, retrieves. It's coins.

The

inbox is a smart contract. Allowing for a trustless. Decentralized. A trustless a fully trustless Inbox fully, trustless. Social importance driven.

The

recipient. Has two simple parameters. Which in real time. Can change. The order. Of the messages. Such a change, only takes effect for New messages old messages. Have. The, or their order guaranteed.

These

two parameters. Allow.

Are

explained in detail here. In the toy to a white paper. Called. And, And the twitter white paper, okay?

Um,

And, Okay, that's good. Links. Are of the following format, https. Colon slash slash. Toy.io. Question, mark a equals. Something. Here. A. Can be changed. To refer to. Different types. Of. Addresses. Different form types of addresses. Twitter will be available omniDLT Omnine quotes. All major ones. The. The dap. The front end. Will also exist decentralized. On. Probably decentralized. On, on some decentralized. A storage. Uh, as Bundle of wasm and javascript. As was him and JavaScript maybe something like that. And,

The

smart contracts. Will hold. Literally any coin. On any DLT supported. Any coin on any dilty supported. And, The recipient. On reply. Will. Unlock the coins. And the recipient can at any time. Retrieve. Unlocked coins. From the inbox.

Um,

alternatively. They can be an improvement. With. Or. Transfer. If possible, but Limits to consider. So that would be an auto feature. For the next improved version. If needed.

But i

don't know if there's no article,

however, that can be Added to the front end because It could initiate this transfer. Ah yeah, if you turn on the auto feature it, initiates it But you still have to sign it, right? You don't want to give away power. Do you always have to sign into for security, but it can be auto initiated if you choose so, or just let it Accumulate. And then save. Transaction costs. The only costs are transactions. Um, We still have not decided whether. The sender. Should try. To cover. The transaction costs. Of the receiver. To reply. The problem is, That the Costs. Can be difficult to predict depending on the DLT. The most widely adopted DLT, the EVM. For example. Can. Change significantly. And even short periods of time.

The

sender could. Send the best estimate. If we make it an option, it complicates the system. For the user. Better. We choose. Some way. Since the sender has to, Pay for its own transaction cost. Anyways to some eath, some gas. Has to be paid. Sometimes has to be paid the the coin to pay the transaction cost. Yeah, the transaction cause coins. Must already be existently. Some must be existing. The sender must have at least some. So, we could For example, approximately double that or Or. Estimated, as best as possible given. Yeah, estimate as best as possible, and just add that. To the initial send transaction. Making the Recipients. Life easier. Otherwise, we're basically saying to the recipient You need to because to descend saying to the sender, you need to have some coins to send the message, which comes with some coins. Make sense. But to say to a recipient, you need some coins. In order to receive coins is more awkward. Um, At the same time. Huh. Is it even possible? In all DLTs probably not to. Paid the transaction fee for someone else. I don't know whether the EVM allows that for example. Delegated transaction fees. Algorand does All right. But up to a maximum, huh? Imagine The the sender would be saying. You can pay. You know, whatever the transaction will cost. Yeah, if it gives that right. Whatever. The transaction will cost. But up to a maximum of, let's say double of my current transaction cost. Like if it if it doubles more than doubles, i'm not paying it for you. You have to pay yourself. Right, if you want to. But up to double. You can take it out of my account, and then yeah, if you can give that right delegated transaction. Cost, i don't know if let's check whether the EVM can do that.

So,

the dlt that can handle that. Let's add it because yeah, that makes it easier for the recipient to recipient. Shouldn't need to have any coins. Um, ideally If it's possible, and those DLTs that don't support that, There's no need then right there, that's one. Has to pay for the fees but you could replenish them so they don't have to constantly have the that gas coin. So you could have a replenishment. So, economic costs, Is the same to the sender on this one. Uh, but it's like it's a bit less efficient. Okay, that depends on the dlt. And the deities will look at EVM. Altos on EVM starting. Uh, of course. No, we're not going to list them. Uh, Each DLT. Contains a treasury that Takes 10 percent of each. Of each time, the receiver. Takes. Retrieves. Coins. From the Inbox your info box. From the inbox. The treasury is sent 10 percent. Rounded down. Rounded down. Rounded down. Rounded down. The treasury in return. Provides. A 2i2y. Coin. Both. Descender. And, Or receiver.

Ideally.

They are. Sent in exchange to the inbox. And the sender or receiver can. The toy toy coins. Whenever they want to. Yeah, i mean, alternative is to send it to descendant, receiver. Automatically but only but then what if they were not opted in in some DLTs you have to You know, permissioned. If you if you're not, maybe you're interested. But then, you know, how do you accumulate it? Or you say well, we try. And if you if you're not If you're not there, whatever.

Or.

We just send it to the. To your inbox, you know, send it to the inbox. Yeah, that makes sense. The inbox paid Attacks. Got the two-way in exchange. And, Any sender can pull from there, right? Of course, that cost storage and Removing the store, but it removing the storage. Yeah, is taking it out. Um, Yeah. And if you don't well, you're missing out but it's yeah, there is locked energy there. Yes, it is energy and this is the tax is worth, you know, so to speak. Okay, i like that nice decentralized solution.

These

tokens. Allow. For governance.

By.

To update the effects. Um, smart contract. Which, And um, The treasury is a smart treasury. Of the Vp placeholder style. Is a buyback and make machine is a buyback. And make smart treasury as described there. And,

The

toy to i coins, allow Governance, for example. Updates of the effect smart contract. Which the effect smart contract. Given. A currency. Either. Returns. Subjective in case the currency is a subjective value. Or returns. A. Numerical value. Which defines the effects rate of this currency of the input currency. Versus a defined. Globally defined base. Currency. Base objective currency. The smart contract. Goes to. Liquid. Markets. To retrieve. The current. Spot rate. As. A t-vap for example, tvap or Mid spread.

The

community can add or remove. Currencies from the objective. Uh, Add a remove. Move. A currency. Between the dichotomy of. Objective and subjective. Value currencies.

Or

upgrade or update. Liquidity requirements, or Market. Links to. The markets. Used for the data. For example. Switching to another decks. Looking at another decks. The treasury bridges. Over. Dlts. To tie. The economic benefit. Of the toy to, i took an altogether, anyone holding it to eye to eye token benefits from the activity on any DLT. In a decentralized manner.

The

end goal is complete decentralization.

With

two white wide, token holders deciding everything.

The

front end. Which lives on decentralized storage. Has a centralized. Location. Which links to? The different versions, including the latest. This allows for users. To always.

Use.

Uh, to Receive. Seamless updates.

In a decentralized manner. The

code being open source. Of course. Allows users to access older versions. If? Wanted. As well.

The.

Asynchronous nature. Of replying to messages. Whenever and if ever one wants to, Makes this a no cost. Only. Potential. Profit.

Proposition.

Everyone. Everyone should create. And publish. It's Twi to, i Address. Ask people. Whatever you wanted to ask.

Finally, everyone gets access to everyone. In a fair manner.
